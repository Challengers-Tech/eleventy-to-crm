## What You'll Get in Your Assessment

### 1. Revenue Leak Detection
Our specialists will review your current sales process to identify where deals are slipping through the cracks. On average, we find 3-5 areas where simple changes can increase close rates by 15-30%.

### 2. Conversion Analysis
We'll examine your funnel at every stage:
- Lead generation and qualification efficiency
- Demo-to-proposal conversion rates
- Proposal-to-close ratios
- Average sales cycle length
- Win/loss patterns and trends

### 3. Performance Benchmarking
See exactly how you stack up against:
- Top performers in your industry
- Companies at similar revenue stages
- Best-in-class sales organizations
- Your own historical performance

### 4. Technology Stack Review
We'll evaluate:
- Your CRM utilization and adoption
- Sales automation opportunities
- Integration gaps causing manual work
- Tools you're paying for but not using
- Missing technology that could 10x productivity

### 5. Process Optimization Opportunities
Discover specific improvements in:
- Prospecting and lead generation
- Qualification and discovery methodology
- Presentation and demo effectiveness
- Objection handling frameworks
- Closing techniques and follow-up
- Pipeline management and forecasting

### 6. Custom Action Plan
You'll receive:
- Prioritized recommendations based on impact and effort
- Quick wins you can implement immediately (0-30 days)
- Medium-term initiatives for sustainable growth (30-90 days)
- Long-term strategic opportunities (90+ days)
- Estimated revenue impact of each recommendation

## Who This Is For

### Perfect for sales leaders who:
- Are missing revenue targets and need to turn things around
- Have a sales team that's underperforming its potential
- Want to scale revenue without proportionally scaling headcount
- Are experiencing long sales cycles or low close rates
- Need to improve pipeline predictability and forecasting
- Are considering investing in sales tools or training
- Want an unbiased expert opinion on their sales operation

### Not a good fit if:
- You're not open to making changes
- You don't have at least 2 salespeople
- You're not ready to invest in growth (even if free advice is valuable)

## The Assessment Process

### Step 1: Application
Fill out the form above. Be specific about your challenges so we can prepare.

### Step 2: Pre-Assessment Survey
We'll send you a brief questionnaire to gather baseline data about your sales metrics and processes.

### Step 3: 30-Minute Consultation
Schedule a video call with one of our certified sales optimization specialists. We'll deep-dive into your situation.

### Step 4: Analysis & Report
Within 48 hours, you'll receive a detailed report with findings and recommendations.

### Step 5: Follow-Up (Optional)
If you want to discuss implementation, we're happy to chat. Zero obligation.
